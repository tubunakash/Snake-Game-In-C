# Snake-Game-In-C
This Mini Project in C Snake Game is a simple console application without graphics. In this project, we can play the popular “Snake Game” just like we played it elsewhere. We have to use the up, down, right or left arrows to move the snake.

Foods are provided at the several co-ordinates of the screen for the snake to eat. Every time the snake eats the food, its length will by increased by one element along with the score.

Many functions have been used in this Snake mini project. Here, I will just list them below and describe the functions “gotoxy”, “GotoXY” and “delay” as they are some of the most important functions used in this and many mini projects in C.

void record()
void load()
void Delay(long double)
void Move()
void Food()
void Print()
void Bend()
int Score()
void Boarder()
void Down()
void Left()
void Up()
void Right()
void ExitGame()

This mini project in C Snake game gives users a total of three lives to play the game. The life-count decreases as the snake hits the wall or its own body. In this mini project, we can even pause the game in the middle by pressing any key, and we can press any key again to continue.
